# Medium CLI

> Medium from your command line!

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g medium-cli
```

## Usage

There are four commands: `medium create`, `medium login`, `medium publish`, and `medium open`.

### `create` <directory name>

```
$ medium create buzzfeed

  medium · Successfully created your blog!

```

This command creates a new sub directory <directory name> in your current directory, with two example articles. The directory looks like this:

```
.
├── articles
|   ├── 12-classic-love-scenes-improved-by-a-chipotle-burrito
|   |   └── index.md
|   └── 51-corgi-gifs-that-will-change-your-life
|       └── index.md
└── .gitignore
```

The `index.md` files are the blog posts. More on this later.

### `login`

```
$ medium login

  medium · Please open https://medium.com/me/settings in your browser.
         · At the bottom of the page, under `Integration Tokens`, copy
         · this description:

         · "Medium-CLI basic publishing access."

         · Then generate the new token and copy it.

  Paste your Integration Token here: XXXX

         · Authenticating into Medium..

         · Saved!
```

### `publications`

```
$ medium publications
List of medium publications (id - url)
c8sdks9df - https://medium.com/publication_url

```

This command asks you for your Integration Token (which can be retrieved at the bottom of this [page](https://medium.com/me/settings)). It also auths into Medium to get your user information. Lastly, it saves the token, your `userId`, and your URL to your ~/.netrc file.

### `publish`

```
$ medium publish
```

This command iterates through your `index.md` files in `./articles` and publishes the ones that don't have `published: true` in the front matter to your Medium account.

Here is an [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambtron/medium-cli/master/lib/create/template/articles/12-classic-love-scenes-improved-by-a-chipotle-burrito/index.md) of an `index.md` file:

```markdown
---

canonicalUrl: www.buzzfeed.com/kincairm/12-classic-love-scenes-improved-by-a-chipotle-burr-a4wp#.iab3N1w76

```

Note that `title` is the only field that is required in the front matter, with all the other ones optional. For a list of the accepted possible parameters, see Medium's API documentation [here](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs/#creating-a-post). `contentFormat` and `content` are not required in the front matter, as they are both added later by the `medium publish` command.

For each successful post, the `medium publish` command also adds `published: true` to the front matter. Note that you can add a `publicationID` to the front matter to publish to a publication instead of your personal blog.

### `open`

```
$ medium open
```

This directs your browser to your Medium page. You need to have `medium login` first to set your Medium URL.
